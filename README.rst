Interactive Gym is a library that provides a generalized interface for creating interactive, browser-based experiments from simulation environments. More specifically, 
it is meant to take Python-based Gymnasium or PettingZoo formatted environments and run them in the browser such that humans can interact with the 
environments either alone or alongside AI or other humans.
