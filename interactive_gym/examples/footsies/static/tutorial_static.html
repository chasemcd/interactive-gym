<p>        
    Footsies is a simplified 2D fighting game that focuses on the fundamental aspects of combat. 
    With just basic movement and a single attack button, you must carefully manage space 
    and predict your opponent's actions to win.
</p>


<h3>Controls</h3>
<p>

    You will control the fighter on the left hand side of the screen. 
    

    <br><br>
    The controls are simple: use the <img src="static/assets/keys/icons8-a-key-50.png" alt="A key" height="24" width="24" style="vertical-align:middle;"> and <img src="static/assets/keys/icons8-d-key-50.png" alt="A key" height="24" width="24" style="vertical-align:middle;"> keys to move your character, and press 
    the space bar <img src="static/assets/keys/icons8-space-key-50.png" alt="Space key" height="24" width="24" style="vertical-align:middle;"> to perform an attack.

    <br><br>
    There is not a separate key to block: moving backwards (<img src="static/assets/keys/icons8-a-key-50.png" alt="A key" height="24" width="24" style="vertical-align:middle;">) will allow you to block attacks and move away from your opponent.


    <br><br>
    There are three special moves you can perform in addition to the basic attacks and movements:
    <ul>
        <li>Forward Dash: Double tap  <img src="static/assets/keys/icons8-d-key-50.png" alt="A key" height="24" width="24" style="vertical-align:middle;"> quickly</li>
        <li>Backward Dash: Double tap <img src="static/assets/keys/icons8-a-key-50.png" alt="A key" height="24" width="24" style="vertical-align:middle;"> quickly</li>
        <li>Special Attack: Hold space bar <img src="static/assets/keys/icons8-space-key-50.png" alt="Space key" height="24" width="24" style="vertical-align:middle;"> for at least 1 second (while standing still or moving forward), then release to attack</li>
    </ul>
</p>



<h3> Health </h3>
    Both players have a "guard health" in the top corners of the screen, shown in the image above. Every time you block a hit, you lose one of your three initial guard health points. 
    If you lose all of your guard health, future attempts to block attacks will fail and you'll be left in "guard break" and unable to block follow-up attacks. 
    

<h3> Knockouts (KOs) </h3>
    You win a round when you KO your opponent. This happens when you land a special attack or combo on your opponent. There is not "health bar," you simply must land a critical hit to KO your opponent.



<h3>Beginning the Study</h3>
<p>
    When you are ready to begin, press continue. You will start by playing 10 rounds against a CPU opponent, then 30 rounds with a training CPU, and finally 10 rounds against the final opponent where you can earn your bonus.
