        You'll be playing a simply fighting game against an AI opponent. 
        Over the course of the experiment, you'll work to hone-in your skills.
        After a training phase, you'll be able to earn a bonus by beating the AI.
    <p>
        <b>Here's how the experiment will work.</b>
        <ol>
            <li>First, you'll play 5 rounds against an initial AI opponent.</li>
            <li>Next, you'll practice the game for 25 rounds against an AI training partner.</li>
            <li>Finally, you'll play 10 rounds against the AI and earn your bonus.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        Your bonus will be based on your performance against the AI in the final 10 rounds. You should attempt 
        to learn as much as you can from the training partner before the final rounds to build up your skills: <b> for each time you 
        win in these final rounds, you'll earn a bonus of $0.50.</b>
