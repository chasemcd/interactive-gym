    <p>
        In this study, you'll be playing a simple fighting game against an CPU opponent. 
        Over the course of the study, you'll work to hone-in your skills.
        After a training phase, you'll be able to earn a bonus by beating the CPU.
    <p>
        <b>Here's how the study will work.</b>
        <ol>
            <li>Before you begin, you'll fill our a brief survey.</li>
            <li>You'll first have an initial set of 5 rounds against an CPU opponent.</li>
            <li>Next, you'll practice the game for 40 rounds against an CPU training partner.</li>
            <li>We'll ask a brief survey about your experience with the training partner.</li>
            <li>Finally, you'll play 10 rounds against the CPU and earn your bonus.</li>
            <li>Before ending, you'll answer a few final questions about your experience with the game and your CPU opponents.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        Your bonus will be based on your performance against the CPU in the final 10 rounds. You should attempt 
        to learn as much as you can from the training partner before the final rounds to build up your skills: <b> for each time you 
        win in these final rounds, you'll earn a bonus of $0.50.</b>
    </p>
