    <p>
        In this study, you'll be playing a simple fighting game against an computer-controlled opponent ("CPU"). 
        Over the course of the study, you'll work to hone-in your skills and learn effective strategies. 
        After a training phase, you'll be able to earn a bonus by beating the CPU in the "final challenge" rounds.
    <p>
        <b>Here's how the study will progress.</b>
        <ol>
            <li>Before you begin, you'll fill our a brief survey.</li>
            <li>You'll first have an initial set of 10 rounds against a CPU opponent.</li>
            <li>Next, you'll practice the game for 30 rounds against a CPU training partner. <b> The goal here is to become as skilled as possible so that you can earn a bonus in the final rounds.</b></li>
            <li>We'll ask a brief survey about your experience with the training partner.</li>
            <li>Finally, you'll play 10 rounds against the "final challenge" CPU and earn your bonus.</li>
            <li>Before ending, you'll answer a few final questions about your experience with the game and your CPU opponents.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        Your bonus will be based on your performance against the "final challenge" CPU in the final 10 rounds. You should attempt 
        to learn as much as you can from the training partner before the final rounds to build up your skills: <b> each time you 
        win in these final rounds, you'll earn a bonus of $0.50.</b>
